##Node Boilerplate
###A minimal structural design for node app with express, sequelize and some other important libraries.

Creating new app is time consuming, when you have to deal with all core structure and architecture. With lots of 
framework and libraries to choose from npm , it is easier to get lost.

This app is made for me and others interested people to get started faster with NodeJS when creating a new app. After
gaining experience with some previous projects I have tried to use best structure and tools in this app.
